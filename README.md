Hello my name is Kyle Deng! I'm 17 years old and currently live in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. At the moment, I am a grade 12 student at Longfields-Davidson Heights Secondary School. My favourite classes are computer science and advanced functions, since I enjoy coding and solving math problems. Outside of school, I am an avid music listener, video game player and athlete. Next year, I am planning to study computer science at Universities like Carleton, uOttawa or UofT which will hopefully help me become a software engineer one day.
